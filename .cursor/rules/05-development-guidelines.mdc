# WebUI Development Guidelines

This guide provides best practices for development in the AIProxy WebUI project.

## Important Notes

1. **Do not modify backend code**: The backend code in the [aiproxy/core](mdc:aiproxy/core) directory comes from another repository and should not be modified.
2. **Read-only access to backend**: You can read and search the backend code to understand API structures and data models, but all modifications should be limited to the frontend code.

## Development Process

1. Understand frontend-backend interaction: Before developing new features, first review the backend API implementation to understand available data and operations.
2. Follow existing patterns: New features should follow the project's existing code organization and design patterns.
3. Maintain UI consistency: New UI components should maintain consistency with the existing design.

## Code Style

- Use Vue 3 Composition API
- Keep components with single responsibility
- Handle data transformations in the API layer
- Extract reusable logic into utility functions

## Feature Development Process

1. Add new API functions in [src/api](mdc:src/api)
2. Create new view components in [src/views](mdc:src/views)
3. Add new routes in [src/router](mdc:src/router)
4. Add state management in [src/stores](mdc:src/stores) if needed
5. Update navigation menus to include new features

## Debugging Tips

- Use Vue Developer Tools to debug components
- Check network requests to confirm API interactions
- Reference [aiproxy/core/controller](mdc:aiproxy/core/controller) to understand backend implementation
